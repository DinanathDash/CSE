/*
Given Data:
Speed of spriteBee = 200 pixels per second
Screen width = 2000 pixels
Bits per pixel = 8 bits
1. Time to cross the screen:

Time = Distance / Speed = 2000 / 200 = 10 seconds

2. Bit rate (bps) of spriteBee:

Bit rate = Speed * Bits per pixel = 200 * 8 = 1600 bps

Final Answer:
Time to cross the screen = 10 seconds
Bit rate = 1600 bps

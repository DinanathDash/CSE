'''Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging is a fundamental step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where each word in a sentence is labeled with its grammatical role, such as noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc. The process helps machines understand the syntactic structure of sentences.

Importance of POS Tagging:
Text Analysis and Understanding: POS tagging enables deeper linguistic analysis, helping machines grasp context and meaning in text.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying proper nouns (e.g., names, places) becomes easier with accurate POS tagging.
Syntactic Parsing: Helps in identifying grammatical relationships and sentence structure.
Machine Translation and Chatbots: Ensures accurate translation and response generation by recognizing the role of each word.
Example:
Consider the sentence:
"She enjoys a long walk in the morning."

After POS tagging, it would look like:

She (PRON) - Pronoun
enjoys (VERB) - Verb
a (DET) - Determiner
long (ADJ) - Adjective
walk (NOUN) - Noun
in (PREP) - Preposition
the (DET) - Determiner
morning (NOUN) - Noun

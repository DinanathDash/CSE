Tokenization:
Definition: Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, phrases, or even characters. For example, the sentence "NLP is fascinating" becomes ["NLP", "is", "fascinating"] after tokenization.
Significance: It's a fundamental preprocessing step in NLP. Tokenization helps in analyzing text by isolating meaningful components, enabling tasks like text analysis, search, and machine translation.
Stemming:
Definition: Stemming reduces words to their root or base form by removing suffixes. It uses simple rules without considering the word's meaning. For instance, "running," "runner," and "runs" may all be reduced to "run."
Significance: Stemming speeds up NLP processes by normalizing words, but it may produce non-real words (e.g., "studies" to "studi"). It's useful for applications where accuracy is less critical, like search engines.
Lemmatization:
Definition: Lemmatization reduces words to their base or dictionary form (lemma) while considering context and grammar. For example, "running" becomes "run," and "better" becomes "good."
Significance: It's more accurate than stemming, preserving the meaning of words. Lemmatization is preferred in NLP tasks requiring semantic understanding, such as machine translation and sentiment analysis.

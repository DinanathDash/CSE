Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. It combines computational linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

Three Real-World Applications of NLP:
Chatbots and Virtual Assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant):
Impact: These tools enhance convenience by handling tasks like setting reminders, answering questions, and controlling smart home devices. They make technology accessible to non-technical users and support people with disabilities.
Sentiment Analysis (e.g., Monitoring Social Media):
Impact: Businesses use sentiment analysis to understand public opinion, gauge customer satisfaction, and manage brand reputation. It helps in decision-making by providing insights into market trends and consumer behavior.
Language Translation (e.g., Google Translate):
Impact: Real-time translation breaks language barriers, facilitating communication in international business, travel, and education. It promotes cultural exchange and helps people understand content in different languages.
NLP transforms how we interact with technology, making machines more intuitive and responsive to human needs.

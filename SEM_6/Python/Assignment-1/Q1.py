"""
Classes in Python are fundamental to object-oriented programming (OOP), enabling the creation of reusable and modular code. Here's why they are significant:

1. Encapsulation: Classes allow bundling of data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together. Access control can be implemented using public, protected, and private members.
2. Reusability and Modularity: Code can be organized into self-contained objects, making it easier to maintain and extend. A class can be instantiated multiple times to create objects with shared structure but unique data.
3. Abstraction: Unnecessary details can be hidden while exposing only the necessary functionalities.
Helps in simplifying complex implementations.
4. Inheritance: Allows new classes (child classes) to inherit attributes and methods from existing classes (parent classes). Promotes code reuse and enables hierarchical relationships.
5. Polymorphism: Different classes can define methods with the same name but different implementations. Enables flexibility in designing extensible code.

1. Write the various techniques used for particulate material removal from air and explain mechanism of settling chamber to separate particulate matter from air with a schematic diagram.
Ans: Techniques:
• Gravitational settling chamber
• Cyclone separator
• Fabric filters (baghouse)
• Electrostatic precipitator
• Wet scrubbers
Settling chamber mechanism:
Air velocity is reduced → particles lose momentum → heavier particles settle by gravity at the chamber bottom → cleaned air exits.

2. What is air quality index? Discuss its calculation criteria.
Ans: AQI: A numerical scale representing air pollution level and its health impact.
Calculation:
• Pollutants measured: PM10, PM2.5, SO₂, NO₂, O₃, CO
• Individual pollutant sub-index is computed
• Highest sub-index = AQI

3. Determine the equivalent sound power level from combining the four sound levels of 56, 68, 70, and 48 dB.
Ans: Given: 56, 68, 70, 48 dB
Formula:
L_total = 10 log₁₀(Σ 10^(Li/10))
Calculation (compressed):
= 10 log₁₀( 10^5.6 + 10^6.8 + 10^7.0 + 10^4.8 )
= 10 log₁₀( ~1.58×10⁷ )
≈ 72 dB

4. Discuss municipal solid waste management technique with a suitable schematic diagram.
Ans: Steps:
• Generation
• Storage
• Collection
• Transport
• Segregation
• Processing (composting, RDF, recycling)
• Final disposal (landfill)

5. Discuss the major natural and anthropogenic causes of global warming.
Ans: Natural:
• Volcanic eruptions
• Solar radiation variation
• Natural GHG cycles
Anthropogenic:
• Fossil fuel burning
• Deforestation
• Industrial emissions
• Agriculture (methane)
• Urbanization, transport

6. Explain the mechanism of O3 layer depletion and suggest the remedial measures for minimizing O3 depletion.
Ans: Mechanism:
CFCs → release Cl radicals under UV →
Cl + O₃ → ClO + O₂
ClO + O → Cl + O₂
→ Continuous destruction of O₃.
Remedial:
• Ban CFCs (Montreal Protocol)
• Use HCFC/HFC alternatives
• Reduce NOx emissions
• Strict industrial regulation

7. Differentiate industrial and photochemical smog. Explain mechanism of photochemical smog with a suitable schematic diagram.
Ans: Industrial (London type):
• SO₂ + smoke
• Cold, humid conditions
• Reducing smog
Photochemical (Los Angeles type):
• NOx + hydrocarbons + sunlight
• Warm, dry cities
• Oxidizing smog
Mechanism schematic (text-based):
NOx + VOCs + Sunlight → O3 + PAN + aldehydes → Photochemical smog

8. Define sustainable development; discuss various strategies of rainwater harvesting and watershed management.
Ans: Sustainable development: Meeting present needs without harming future needs.
Rainwater harvesting strategies:
• Rooftop collection
• Surface runoff collection
• Recharge pits
• Percolation tanks
• Check dams
Watershed management:
• Contour bunding
• Gully plugging
• Afforestation
• Soil conservation
• Water storage structures

9. Discuss the objective and function of environmental protection act 1986.
Ans: Objectives:
• Environmental protection and improvement
• Control of pollution
• Establish environmental standards
Functions:
• Set emission and discharge limits
• Regulate hazardous substances
• Inspection and enforcement
• Manage environmental emergencies

10. What is EIA? Discuss the EIA approval process of a newly proposed project with a suitable schematic diagram.
Ans: EIA: Study predicting environmental impact of a proposed project.
Approval process:
• Screening
• Scoping
• Baseline data
• Impact assessment
• Mitigation plan
• Public hearing
• Review by authority
• Final approval

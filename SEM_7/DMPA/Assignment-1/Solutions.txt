1. What is Data Mining? Describe the steps involved in data mining when viewed as a process of knowledge discovery.
Ans: Data Mining is the process of discovering useful patterns, relationships, or insights from large datasets using statistical, machine learning, and database techniques.
Steps in Data Mining (as part of Knowledge Discovery in Databases – KDD):
i. Data Cleaning: Remove noise, errors, duplicates, and missing values.
ii. Data Integration: Combine data from multiple sources into a coherent data store.
iii. Data Selection: Choose relevant data for analysis.
iv. Data Transformation: Convert data into appropriate formats (e.g., normalization, aggregation).
v. Data Mining: Apply algorithms to extract patterns (classification, clustering, association, etc.).
vi. Pattern Evaluation: Identify truly interesting patterns using measures like support, confidence, or lift.
vii. Knowledge Presentation: Visualize or report results for interpretation and decision-making.

2. Define Predictive Analytics and explain its relationship with Data Mining.
Ans: Predictive Analytics uses historical data, statistical models, and machine learning techniques to predict future outcomes.
Relationship:
i. Data Mining provides the patterns and models.
ii. Predictive Analytics applies those models to forecast future events.

3. For each of the following meetings, explain which phase in the CRISP-DM process is represented:
a. Managers want to know by next week whether deployment will take place. Therefore, analysts meet to discuss how useful and accurate their model is.
Ans: Phase: Evaluation (checking performance before deployment).

b. The data mining project manager meets with the data warehousing manager to discuss how the data will be collected.
Ans: Phase: Data Understanding (gathering and exploring data sources).

c. The data mining consultant meets with the Vice President for Marketing, who says that he would like to move forward with customer relationship management.
Ans: Phase: Business Understanding (defining objectives and success criteria).

d. The data mining project manager meets with the production line supervisor, to discuss implementation of changes and improvements.
Ans: Phase: Deployment (putting model into use).

e. The analysts meet to discuss whether the neural network or decision tree models should be applied. 
Ans: Phase: Modeling (selecting and building the appropriate model).

4. What is an outlier? Why do we need to treat outliers carefully?
Ans: Outlier: A data point significantly different from the rest of the dataset (too high or too low).
Why handle carefully:
i. They distort mean and standard deviation.
ii. They mislead models, especially sensitive ones (like regression, clustering).
iii. Sometimes, they indicate errors or rare but important events (fraud, defects).

5. Use the following stock price data (in dollars) to compute mean, median, mode and standard deviation.
Stock Price 10 7 20 12 75 15 9 18 4 12 8 14
Ans: Data: 10, 7, 20, 12, 75, 15, 9, 18, 4, 12, 8, 14
n = 12
Step 1: Sort
{4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 75}
Mean (x̄):
= (4+7+8+9+10+12+12+14+15+18+20+75)/12
= 204 / 12 = 17
Median:
Middle = avg of 6th & 7th = (12 + 12)/2 = 12
Mode:
12 (repeats twice)
Standard Deviation:
Mean = 17
Sum of (xi – mean)² = 3844
Variance = 3844 / 12 = 320.33
SD = √320.33 = 17.89
Answer:
Mean = 17, Median = 12, Mode = 12, SD = 17.89

6. Use the following stock price data (in dollars) to answer the following questions.
Stock Price 10 7 20 12 75 15 9 18 4 12 8 14
Ans: Data: 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 75
Minimum = 4
Maximum = 75
Mean = 17
Standard Deviation = 17.89
a. Find the min-max normalized stock price for the stock worth $20
Ans: X' = (X - Min) / (Max - Min)
X' = (20 - 4) / (75 - 4) = 16 / 71 = 0.225 ≈ 0.23

b. Compute the midrange stock price.
Ans: Midrange = (Max + Min) / 2
Midrange = (75 + 4) / 2 = 39.5

c. Compute the z-score standardized stock price for the stock worth $20
Ans: Z = (X - Mean) / SD
Z = (20 - 17) / 17.89 = 0.168 ≈ 0.17

d. Compute the decimal scaling stock price for the stock worth $20
Ans: Maximum value = 75 → j = 2 (since 10^2 > 75)
X' = X / 10^j = 20 / 100 = 0.20

e. Compute the skewness for the stock price data
Ans: Skewness = (Mean - Mode) / SD
Skewness = (17 - 12) / 17.89 = 0.28 (Positively skewed)

7. Use the given data set for the following questions: 1 1 1 3 3 7
a. Bin the data into three bins of equal width (width = 3).
Ans: Range = 7 - 1 = 6 → Width = 6/3 = 2
Bins:
1–3, 3–5, 5–7
→ Bin1: 1,1,1
→ Bin2: 3,3
→ Bin3: 7
b. Bin the data into three bins of two records each.
Ans: Sorted: 1,1,1,3,3,7
→ Bin1: 1,1
→ Bin2: 1,3
→ Bin3: 3,7

8. Answer following questions: 
a. What is the graphical counterpart of a contingency table?
Ans: Mosaic Plot (or Stacked Bar Chart)

b. What is the difference between taking row percentages and taking column percentages in a contingency table?
Ans: Row %: Each row sums to 100%. Compares categories within a row.
Column %: Each column sums to 100%. Compares categories within a column.

9. For each of the following descriptive methods, state whether it may be applied to categorical data, continuous 
numerical data, or both.

10. Find Q1, Q2, and Q3 for the following data set, and draw a box-and-whisker plot. 
{2,6,7,8,8,11,12,13,14,15,22,23}
Ans: Q2 (Median): (6th + 7th)/2 = (11 + 12)/2 = 11.5
Q1: Median of lower half (2,6,7,8,8,11) = (7+8)/2 = 7.5
Q3: Median of upper half (12,13,14,15,22,23) = (14+15)/2 = 14.5
Box Plot summary:
Min = 2
Q1 = 7.5
Median = 11.5
Q3 = 14.5
Max = 23
→ Slightly right-skewed (longer upper whisker due to 22, 23).

//Pre-Lab Questions
1) A push button is a simple mechanical switch that temporarily makes or breaks an electrical connection when pressed. It is commonly used as an input device to send signals to microcontrollers like Arduino.

2) Common types of push buttons include:
    Momentary (normally open) – connects when pressed, disconnects when released.
    Momentary (normally closed) – disconnects when pressed, connects when released.
    Latching (toggle) – stays in one state until pressed again.
    Illuminated push button – includes an LED indicator inside.

3) Interfacing a push button with Arduino allows the user to provide input or control—for example, turning LEDs ON/OFF, changing modes, or controlling brightness. It helps the Arduino detect and respond to user actions.

4)  Type        Connection                    Default State       Pressed State
    Pull-up     Between input pin and +5V	        HIGH                LOW
    Pull-down   Between input pin and GND	        LOW	                HIGH
    A pull-up resistor keeps the input HIGH when the button is not pressed, while a pull-down resistor keeps it LOW when not pressed.
5) Pull-up: Resistor connects between input pin and +5V, button between input pin and GND.
    Pull-down: Resistor connects between input pin and GND, button between input pin and +5V.
6) The external pull-up resistor ensures the input pin stays at a defined logic HIGH when the button is not pressed.
    Without it, the pin could “float” and cause random HIGH/LOW readings. When the button is pressed, the pin is connected to GND, producing a stable LOW signal.
7) Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique of rapidly switching a digital signal ON and OFF with varying duty cycles (percentage of ON time).
    By changing the duty cycle, we control the average voltage sent to an LED, which adjusts its brightness — higher duty cycle = brighter LED.
8) Yes, PWM can control the brightness of other dimmable lights, such as:
    DC bulbs
    Motors (for speed control)
    Some dimmable LEDs or strips
    However, it cannot directly control AC bulbs or non-dimmable lights without additional driver circuits, because they require AC phase control or specialized dimming hardware.

// Conclusion:
This experiment successfully demonstrated how push buttons can be interfaced with an Arduino to control LEDs and adjust brightness using PWM. It covered the use of pull-up and pull-down resistors for stable input detection, toggle functionality for state switching, and PWM for brightness control. Overall, the experiment helped in understanding digital input handling and output modulation using Arduino.

// Precautions:
Ensure all connections are made correctly before powering the circuit.
Use appropriate resistor values (10kΩ for pull-up/pull-down, 220Ω for LEDs).
Avoid connecting components directly to 5V without current-limiting resistors.
Debounce or delay button inputs to prevent false triggering.

// Post-Lab Questionaire
1) When the push button is pressed in a circuit with an external pull-up resistor (10kΩ), the input pin is connected to GND, so the state of the button will be LOW (0).

2) If the pull-up resistor value changes to 4.7kΩ, the logic remains the same — when the button is pressed, it connects to GND, so the state will still be LOW (0).
(Only current changes slightly; logic doesn’t.)

3) With an internal pull-up resistor enabled, pressing the button connects the pin to GND, so the state of the button will be LOW (0).

4) If the internal pull-up resistor is disabled, the input pin becomes floating when the button is not pressed. When pressed, the state becomes undefined or fluctuating, since there’s no resistor to pull it to a known logic level.

5) With an external pull-down resistor (10kΩ), pressing the button connects the pin to +5V, so the state of the button will be HIGH (1).

6) To find the maximum brightness (maximum current through LED):
R = 220 ohms, Vsupply = 5V, Vf = 2V
I = (Vsupply - Vf) / R
I = (5 - 2) / 220
I = 0.0136 A = 13.6 mA
Maximum brightness current ≈ 13.6 mA (safe below the LED’s 20 mA limit).

7) At 25% PWM duty cycle, average current = 25% of full current:
Iavg = 0.25 × 13.6 mA
Iavg = 3.4 mA
Average current = 3.4 mA

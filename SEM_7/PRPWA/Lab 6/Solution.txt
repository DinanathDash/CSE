//Pre-Lab Questions
1) What are motors and how do they work?
Ans: Motors are electromechanical devices that convert electrical energy into mechanical motion. They operate on the principle of electromagnetism — when current flows through a coil in a magnetic field, it experiences a force that creates rotation.

2) What are the components and mechanisms involved in the operation of a servomotor?
Ans: A servomotor consists of:
i. DC motor (for rotation)
ii. Gearbox (for torque reduction and control)
iii. Feedback sensor (usually a potentiometer to detect position)
iv. Control circuit (to interpret input signals and adjust motor position accordingly)
v. These components form a closed-loop system that continuously corrects the motor’s position.

3) How do torque, speed, and precision relate to the unique features of servomotors?
Ans: Servo motors trade off speed for precision and torque. High torque allows precise control of load movement, while built-in feedback ensures accuracy of position, making servos ideal for applications requiring controlled angular motion rather than continuous rotation.

4) What are some common applications for servomotors in embedded systems?
Ans: i. Robotic arms and grippers
ii. Camera gimbals and pan-tilt systems
iii. RC vehicles (steering and throttle)
iv. Automated control systems (valves, actuators, etc.)
v. Drones for control surfaces and stabilization

5) What is the role of feedback in motor control, and how can it be implemented with Arduino?
Ans: Feedback provides real-time data about the motor’s position or speed, enabling correction if the motor deviates from its target. In Arduino, feedback can be implemented using sensors (e.g., potentiometer or encoder) to read actual position values and adjust PWM output accordingly.

6) What is the difference between open-loop and closed-loop motor control, and how can Arduino be used to implement closed-loop control?
Ans: i. Open-loop control: No feedback; the motor runs based only on input signal.
ii. Closed-loop control: Uses feedback to monitor and correct performance.
Arduino can implement closed-loop control by reading sensor data (e.g., position via potentiometer) and adjusting output signals dynamically using a control algorithm like PID.

7) What is the purpose of the servo library in Arduino?
Ans: The Arduino Servo library provides predefined functions to generate the correct PWM control signals for servo motors, making it easy to set servo positions using simple commands like servo.write(angle) without manually managing pulse timing.

8) What are the applications of servo motors in embedded systems?
Ans: Servo motors are used wherever precise position, angle, or speed control is required — robotics, automation, CNC machines, camera systems, and mechatronic projects.

9) What is the role of pulse width modulation (PWM) in servo control?
Ans: PWM determines the angular position of a servo motor. The width (duration) of the control pulse defines how far the motor shaft rotates. Standard servos expect pulses between 1 ms and 2 ms every 20 ms.

10) How is the position of a servo motor related to the duty cycle of the PWM signal?
Ans: A duty cycle of around 5% (1 ms pulse) corresponds to 0°, and about 10% (2 ms pulse) corresponds to 180°. Intermediate pulse widths produce proportional angular positions.

11) What is the purpose of mapping the analog input value to the corresponding servo position value?
Ans: Mapping converts sensor readings (e.g., 0–1023 from a potentiometer) into a usable servo range (0–180°). It ensures that the full range of analog input corresponds proportionally to the full motion range of the servo motor.

12) What is the difference between digital and analog signals, and how are they used in servo control?
Ans: i. Analog signals: Continuous voltage levels (e.g., from sensors like potentiometers or LDRs).
ii. Digital signals: Discrete on/off pulses used for control (like PWM).
In servo control, analog signals are read for input (position or feedback), while digital PWM signals are generated to drive the servo.

//Observation:
// Objective 1: A servomotor operates based on PWM signals generated by Arduino, where pulse width determines shaft position. Using sensors like potentiometers or serial inputs allows precise angular control through real-time feedback.

// Objective 2: Analog sensors such as LDRs and joysticks provide variable voltage signals that Arduino reads and maps to servo positions. This enables dynamic, sensor-based control of motion, demonstrating data-driven actuation in embedded systems.

// Conclusion: The experiment successfully demonstrated how Arduino can precisely control servo motors using PWM signals and analog inputs such as potentiometers, LDRs, and joysticks. It showed effective mapping between sensor data and servo motion, highlighting the role of feedback and closed-loop control in embedded systems.

// Precautions: Ensure correct wiring of power, signal, and ground pins to avoid servo damage. Use external power if multiple servos are connected. Avoid sudden large angle changes to prevent mechanical strain, and verify sensor calibration before operation.

// Post-Lab Questionaire:
1) What is laser beam control using two servo motors, and what are its practical applications?
Ans: Laser beam control using two servo motors involves mounting a laser diode on a two-axis servo setup—one controlling horizontal (X-axis) and the other vertical (Y-axis) movement. This allows precise aiming or scanning of the laser. Practical applications include laser engraving, alignment systems, target tracking, optical communication, and robotics vision calibration.

2) How can advanced control techniques be used to demonstrate the versatility of servo motors in embedded systems?
Ans: Advanced control techniques like coordinated multi-servo motion, feedback-based positioning, or sensor-guided tracking showcase servo versatility. These techniques enable complex automation tasks such as robotic arms, camera gimbals, self-stabilizing platforms, and precision targeting systems, proving the adaptability of servos in real-world embedded applications.

3) What are the principles of using two servo motors to direct a laser beam, and how is this useful in practical applications?
Ans: Two perpendicular servos form a pan-tilt mechanism that adjusts the laser’s horizontal and vertical angles. By controlling each servo’s position via PWM, the laser can be accurately pointed anywhere within its range. This principle enables controlled scanning, precise marking, and automated alignment in industrial, robotic, and optical systems.\

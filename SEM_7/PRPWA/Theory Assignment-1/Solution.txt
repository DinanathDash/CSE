Station (STA)               Connects to an existing Wi-Fi router/network        Arduino sending data to server
Access Point (AP)           Acts as a Wi-Fi hotspot for other devices           Local wireless control
STA + AP                    Works as both simultaneously                        Remote monitoring and local access together

6. Explain the function of the AT commands AT, AT+RST, and AT+CWJAP.

8. Describe how serial communication occurs between the Arduino UNO and the ESP01 module.
Ans: Serial communication between Arduino UNO and ESP-01
Uses UART (TX/RX) serial lines. Arduino’s TX sends data to ESP’s RX (via voltage divider), and ESP’s TX returns responses to Arduino’s RX. Both communicate through serial commands at a set baud rate.

9. Why is a voltage divider circuit or logic level converter required when connecting Arduino TX (5V) to ESP-01 RX (3.3V)?

Using a voltage divider or logic shifter prevents overvoltage damage to the ESP-01 input pin.

10. What is the purpose of using the AT+CWJAP="SSID","PASSWORD" command during ESP01 configuration.

"""The following two exceptions may be raised while executing the statement result = a + b:

TypeError:

This occurs when the operands a and b are of incompatible types for addition. For example, trying to add a string to an integer ('5' + 3) or a list to a number will raise a TypeError.
Example:
python
Copy code
a = "Hello"
b = 5
result = a + b  # Raises TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
NameError:

This occurs if either a or b is not defined before the addition operation is attempted. If you try to use variables that haven't been assigned values, a NameError will be raised.
Example:
python
Copy code
result = a + b  # Raises NameError: name 'a' is not defined
These are two common exceptions that might arise depending on the values or types of a and b."""
